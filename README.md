Respiratory sounds are important indicators of respiratory health and respiratory disorders. The sound emitted when a person breathes is directly related to air movement, changes within lung tissue and the position of secretions within the lung.

This digital data opens up the possibility of using machine learning to automatically diagnose respiratory disorders like asthma, pneumonia and bronchiolitis, to name a few.
MODELING

Each feature is an matrix of frequencies which is treated as an heatmap of frequencies and passed through different model paths for specific training and then concatenated for general optimisation and classification. The model is Keras Function API Convotional Model with BatchNormalization and ReLU activation.
